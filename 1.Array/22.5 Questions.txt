High Five guys!

Now as u have gathered so much knowledge about array so I think so u will be able to do some other problems too. So here are the two problems which u can try yourself.1. 

1.N-bonacci Numbers: Print first M N-bonacci no.  		(Fibonacci
						 (2-bonacci

I/p: N=3,    M=8
O/p: 0 0 1 1 2 4 7 13


I/p: N=4,   M=10
o/p: 0 0 0 1  1 2 4 8 15 29  

Complexity: O(NxM)


2. Count distinct elements in every window of size k.
(use Hashing)

i/p: 1 2 1 3 4 3 3
k=4
o/p: 3 4 3 2

Time complexity O(n)
